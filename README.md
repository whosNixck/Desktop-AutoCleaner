# Desktop AutoCleaner

This program is a semi-automatic file system. It allows sorting different files into separate folders at the push of a button. Additionally, the program automatically creates the necessary folders.

## Language

The program is currently only available in German.

## How It Works

1. Start the program.
2. Select a folder you want to organize.
3. The program moves the files into automatically created subfolders based on their file types.

## Which Files Are Sorted?

Files are categorized as follows:

- **Images**: `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.docm`
- **Videos**: `.mp4`, `.mov`
- **Audio**: `.mp3`, `.wav`
- **Tables**: `.xlsm`, `.csv`
- **Presentations**: `.pptx`, `.odp`
- **Compressed Files**: `.zip`, `.7z`, `.rar`

All other file types will be moved to the **"Others"** folder.

## Development

I currently don't have time to further develop the program. However, I will answer questions and merge pull requests.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
